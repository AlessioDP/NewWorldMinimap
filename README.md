# CptWesley's Minimap
Minimap for [Amazon's New World](https://www.newworld.com/).
The application uses Overwolf's approved API for getting character positions.
It then utilizes data obtained from [StudioLoot's New World Interactive Map](https://www.newworld-map.com/) to render all objects of interest around the player.
